# NaPoGenMo2016
National Poetry Generation Month 2016 - based on an idea @hugovk [tweeted](https://twitter.com/hugovk/status/582991364889059330) on a whim. This is the 2016 edition. You can check out the [2015](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2015) edition if you like.

## The Goal

Spend the month of April writing code that generates a poem.
Repeat.


## The Rules

The only rule is that you share at least one poem  and also your source code at the end.

The source code does not have to be licensed in a particular way, so long as you share it. The code itself does not need to be on GitHub, either. I'm just using this repo as a place to organize the community.

The "poem" is defined however you want. It could be 49,999 repetitions of the word "meow". It could literally grab a random poem from Project Gutenberg. It doesn't matter, as long as it's < 50K words (since 50K+ words would [be a novel](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015).

Please try to respect copyright. I'm not going to police it, as ultimately it's on your head if you want to just copy/paste a Allen Ginsberg Poem or whatever, but the most useful/interesting implementations are going to be ones that don't engender lawsuits.

This activity starts at 12:01am GMT on Apr 1st and ends at 12:01am GMT May 1st.


## How to Participate

[Open an issue](../../issues/new) on this repo and declare your intent to participate. You may continually update the issue as you work over the course of the month. Feel free to post dev diaries, sample output, etc.

Also feel free to comment on other participants' issues.


## Resources

There's an [open issue](../../issues/1) where you can add resources (libraries, corpuses, APIs, techniques, etc).

There are already a ton of resources on the old resources thread for the [2015 edition](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2015/issues/1).

## That's It

So yeah. Have fun with this!
